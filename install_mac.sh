# Real-Time Translator - macOS Installation Script
# ==================================================
# This script automates the setup process for the Real-Time Translator.
# It will:
#   1. Verify Python 3 is installed
#   2. Create a virtual environment for isolated dependencies
#   3. Install all required Python packages
#   4. Install Apple Silicon optimizations (if applicable)
#   5. Check for required system tools (ffmpeg)
#   6. Verify BlackHole virtual audio device installation
#   7. Check for optional audio management tools

echo "==================================================="
echo "  Real-Time Translator - macOS Installer"
echo "==================================================="

# ==================================================
# Step 1: Verify Python 3 Installation
# ==================================================
# Python 3.8+ is required to run this application.
# If not found, the script will exit with an error message.
if ! command -v python3 &> /dev/null; then
    echo "[ERROR] Python 3 is not installed."
    echo "Please install it via brew: brew install python"

fi

# ==================================================
# Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
# ==================================================
# A virtual environment (.venv) isolates Python packages from your system,
# preventing conflicts with other projects. If .venv already exists,
# we'll skip this step and reuse the existing environment.
if [ ! -d ".venv" ]; then
    echo "[1/4] Creating virtual environment (.venv)..."
    python3 -m venv .venv
else
    echo "[1/4] Virtual environment exists."
fi

# ==================================================
# Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
# ==================================================
# Activates the virtual environment and installs all required packages
# from requirements.txt, including:
#   - PyQt6 (GUI framework)
#   - faster-whisper (speech recognition)
#   - funasr (Alibaba ASR engine)
#   - sounddevice (audio capture)
#   - openai (translation API)
#   - And other essential libraries

pip install -r requirements.txt

# ==================================================
# Step 4: Apple Silicon (mlx-whisper)
# ==================================================
# mlx-whisper is listed in requirements.txt with marker:
#   mlx-whisper; sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine == 'arm64'
# It is installed automatically on M1/M2/M3/M4 during Step 3.
# In Dashboard / config.ini set: backend = mlx
ARCH=$(uname -m)
if [ "$ARCH" = "arm64" ]; then
    echo "[3/4] Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) — mlx-whisper included via requirements.txt"

# ==================================================
# Step 5: Check System Dependencies
# ==================================================
# FFmpeg is required for audio processing and format conversion.
# It's used internally by the speech recognition engines.
# If missing, the script will warn you but continue installation.
echo "[4/5] Checking system tools..."

# ==================================================
# Step 6: Check BlackHole Virtual Audio Device
# ==================================================
# BlackHole is a virtual audio driver that allows you to capture
# system audio output (e.g., from Zoom, YouTube, games) as if it
# were a microphone input. This is essential for real-time
# transcription of audio playing on your Mac.
#
# Without BlackHole, you can only transcribe from physical microphones.
# Installation: brew install blackhole-2ch

    echo "  -> Install via Homebrew: brew install blackhole-2ch"
    echo "  -> Or download from: https://existential.audio/blackhole/"
    echo ""

# ==================================================
# Step 7: Check Optional Tools
# ==================================================
# SwitchAudioSource (optional) allows the dashboard to programmatically
# switch audio devices. This is convenient but not required.
# Without it, you'll need to manually change audio settings in macOS.
#
# Installation: brew install switchaudio-osx
if command -v SwitchAudioSource &> /dev/null; then
    echo "  [OK] SwitchAudioSource found (for device management)."
else
    echo "  [INFO] SwitchAudioSource not found (optional)."
    echo "  -> Install for better device management: brew install switchaudio-osx"
